# Day 1
## Why Django + React?
- I compared different stacks (Flask, Node.js, Jamstack)
- decided on Django + React because:
  - Django leverages my Python skills and gives me a structured backend (ORM, admin panel, auth)
  - React provides a modern, interactive frontend for quizzes, downloads, and videos
  - together, balance productivity now and scalability later

## What I Did
- installed Django and created my first project (`mysite`)
- learned about a django project structure (settings, urls, views, models)

## What I Learned
- Django is a full‑stack framework with batteries included
- difference between a project (overall site) and an app (specific feature)
- how Django’s MVT pattern works (Model-View-Template)

## Next
- explore Django apps in detail.
- learn how templates work to render HTML pages

# Day 2
## What I Did
- created a new app inside my Django project
- learned how to set up templates for rendering HTML
- built my first template with a heading and paragraph lol
- connected the template to a view and URL route
- ran the server and confirmed the page loads correctly

## What I Learned
- role of `urls.py` in mapping routes to views
- how `views.py` connects backend logic to frontend templates

## Next
- start building models
- Django’s admin panel to manage content.
