# Day 1 – 21 Feb 2026

## Why Django + React?
- I compared different stacks (Flask, Node.js, Jamstack)
- Decided on Django + React because:
  - Django leverages my Python skills and gives me a structured backend (ORM, admin panel, auth)
  - React provides a modern, interactive frontend for quizzes, downloads, and videos
  - Together, they balance productivity now and scalability later

## What I Did
- Installed Django and created my first project (`mysite`)
- Learned about a django project structure (settings, urls, views, models)

## What I Learned
- Django is a full‑stack framework with batteries included
- The difference between a project (overall site) and an app (specific feature)
- How Django’s MVT pattern works (Model-View-Template)

## Next Steps
- Explore Django apps in detail.
- Learn how templates work to render HTML pages
